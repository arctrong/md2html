# About this section

This section describes documentation source text writing and covers such topics as Markdown
syntax, formatting examples and tricks. The templates and styling question, as well as the 
documentation structuring, are discussed in the other sections.

The complete Markdown guide is not provided in this section, so see 
[the original syntax description](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
for more details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example source texts

This documentation is written solely using the **M<sub>2</sub>H** program and itself demonstrates
the possible result that may be obtained. The source Markdown text files may be viewed using the 
"Source text" link ("&lt;/&gt;") in the page title block.

# Text effects

<div class="tableGridded"></div>

Text effect | Markdown/HTML syntax | Comments
---|---|:---:
**bold** | `__bold__` or `**bold**` |  |
*italic* | `_italic_` or `*italic*` |  | 
`in-line <code> fragment` | `` `in-line <code> fragment` `` |   |
<span class="code">escaped &lt;code&gt; fragment</span> | `<span class="code">escaped &lt;code&gt; fragment</span>` | 1
<del>deleted</del> | `<del>deleted</del>` | 2
<ins>inserted</ins> | `<ins>inserted</ins>` | 2
Normal text<sub>subscript</sub> | `Normal text<sub>subscript</sub>` | 3
Normal text<sup>superscript</sup> | `Normal text<sup>superscript</sup>` | 3
--- (em-dash, `&mdash;`) | `---` |   |

!!! note "Comments"
    1. Sometimes it's required to show HTML entities inside a code block, but the standard Markdown
        syntax (with backticks) will show the content as is. For this purpose the CSS class `code`
        was defined, so direct HTML inclusions may be a suitable workaround. For example, 
        [here](<!--page plugins-->#escaped_code_text_example) we wanted to avoid processing the code text
        by the `index` plugin.
    2. Special markdown syntax for inserted (`++inserted++`) and deleted (`~~deleted~~`)
        text is not implemented in this program. First, these effects must not be required very
        often. Second, such markup may cause problems if we write text like "C++", or `++i`.
        The used direct HTML markup lets achieve these effects safely.
    3. Subscript and superscript are not in the Markdown syntax. Here direct HTML markup
        is used as a possible workaround.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Horizontal line

Horizontal line (`<hr />`) may be inserted by placing several dashes (`----`).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Paragraphs and line breaks

A paragraph (`<p>`) is inserted by an empty line.    
A line break (`<br />`) may be inserted by leaving more than two spaces at the end of line
(as it's done in the previous line).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<a name="headers"></a>
# Headers

Headers are inserted using one to six pound symbols (`#`) at the beginning of line. This
makes headers from `<h1>` to `<h6>` respectively. Other ways are described
[here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header).

Dashes and equal signs may be interpreted as header marks of the previous line, so to avoid this
markup it's better, and sometimes required, to leave an empty line before these sequences.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Table of contents

`[TOC]` element in the Markdown document will resolve into the document's table of contents in
the generated HTML. The example can be seen at the top of this and other pages. The ToC is
composed of the [headers](#headers) found on the page.

!!! note
    Unfortunately by now there's no way to insert a local ToC, i.e. a ToC for a certain header 
    that would contain only the sub-headers of this header.
    
!!! note
    The Python and the Java versions give slightly different ToC appearance. The Java version
    preserves the header text formatting while the Python version removes this formatting. So
    if a header contains e.g. an `inline code block` the Python version will reflect this
    code block as unformatted text in the corresponding ToC item.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Links

The link syntax is:

````
[link text](path/to/doc.html "title")
````

where `"title"` is not required. If `link text` is omitted the link will be not visible.
There's the other syntax:

````
<path/to/doc.html>
````

that will make the link text equal the link location.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<a name="anchor_demo"></a>
# Anchors

The header tags have their automatically generated `id`s so they can be referenced by the links. 
But these `id`s are uncontrolled and will change if the the header changes. Anchors may be added
at the arbitrary places on the page with the syntax:

````
<a name="anchor_name"></a>
````

`id` attribute instead of `name` attribute will also work. Then this anchor may be referenced as:

````
[link text](#anchor_name)
````

from the same page, or:

````
[link text](this_page.html#anchor_name)
````

from the same or the other page.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Images

<p><img src="../pict/penrose.png" alt="Penrose" title="Penrose" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 25px 25px;" /></p>

The standard Markdown image syntax is `![ALT](path/to/image.png "title")`, where `ALT` and
`"title"` are not required.

Here, nonetheless, the example demonstrates the other method that allows placing images
on the page side with the text floating around, that may be very useful with small images. 
This method uses direct HTML inclusions:

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

````
<p><img src="../pict/target.png" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 25px 25px;" /></p>
````

!!! important
    The image tag is enclosed by a paragraph that is required for the currently used styles.
    The Python version does this enclosing itself, but the Java version does not. Though the
    Python version does not do extra enclosing if it's already done. So it's better to always
    add the paragraph.

To stop the text float the following empty paragraph may be used:

````
<p style="clear: both;"></p>
````

An image may be used as a link text like this:

````
[![](../pict/target.png)](page.html)
````

Then we will get a clickable image that works as a link:

[![](../pict/penrose_small.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling "Penrose")

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lists

The following markup:

````
1. This is a __first-level__ _ordered_ list item.
    
    Another paragraph may be added by adding one empty line above and indenting by 4 spaces.
    
    > Other elements, like `<blockquote>`, may be included into a list item.
    
    - This is a __second-level__ _unordered_ list sub-item. The long lines may be wrapped
        with extra 4 space indent without an empty line above.
        3. This is a __third-level__ _ordered_ list sub-item. Any numbers may be used as
            _ordered_ list item markers.
        3. This is another __third-level__ _ordered_ list sub-item.
    - This is another __second-level__ _unordered_ list sub-item.

1. This is another __first-level__ _unordered_ list item. Though `1.` is used as the
    item number this item marker will be "2.".
````

gives the following output:

1. This is a __first-level__ _ordered_ list item.
    
    Another paragraph may be added by adding one empty line above and indenting by 4 spaces.
    
    > Other elements, like `<blockquote>`, may be included into a list item.
    
    - This is a __second-level__ _unordered_ list sub-item. The long lines may be wrapped
        with extra 4 space indent without an empty line above.
        3. This is a __third-level__ _ordered_ list sub-item. Any numbers may be used as
            _ordered_ list item markers.
        3. This is another __third-level__ _ordered_ list sub-item.
    - This is another __second-level__ _unordered_ list sub-item.

1. This is another __first-level__ _unordered_ list item. Though `1.` is used as the
    item number this item marker will be "2.".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Blockquotes

Blockquotes are inserted by starting each line with `> `.

> Links, images and some other Markdown elements may be used inside `blockquote`s:
> 
> - Here's a link with a clickable image:    
>   [![TARGET](../pict/target-smaller.png)](#anchor_demo "How to add an anchor.")
> - Also a list inside this `blockquote` is used for demonstration.

<!--index tables-->
# Tables

Table are added with the syntax like this:

````
Item No | Name  | Description   | Price
:------:|-------|---------------|------:
1       | Chair | Kitchen chair |  87.50
2       | Table | Kitchen table | 450.00
3       | Lamp  | Standard lamp | 120.75
````

Currently used styles define the following default table appearance:

Item No | Name  | Description   | Price
:------:|-------|---------------|------:
1       | Chair | Kitchen chair |  87.50
2       | Table | Kitchen table | 450.00
3       | Lamp  | Standard lamp | 120.75

Markdown doesn't have syntax for different table styles, but some trick may be used to achieve 
this. We can add an invisible element (an empty `<div>` in this case) right before the
table and then define the appearance using some simple CSS magic. So the following invisible
element:

````
<div class="tableLight"></div>
````

Will give the following table stile:

<div class="tableLight"></div>

|Item No | Name  | Description   | Price |
|:------:|:------|:--------------|------:|
|1       | Chair | Kitchen chair |  87.50|
|2       | Table | Kitchen table | 450.00|
|3       | Lamp  | Standard lamp | 120.75|

If we want to just align text we can use a table without a header:

````
<div class="tableLight"></div>

| | | | |
|---:|---: |---: |---: |
| 10 | 20  | 30  | 40  |
| 50 | 60  | 70  | 80  |
| 90 | 100 | 110 | 120 |
````

This will give:

<div class="tableLight"></div>

| | | | |
|---:|---: |---: |---: |
| 10 | 20  | 30  | 40  |
| 50 | 60  | 70  | 80  |
| 90 | 100 | 110 | 120 |

!!! note
    Small extra gap appears above "header-less" tables that is not avoidable as for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--index fenced code blocks -->
# Fenced code blocks

Fenced code blocks may be set up by four-space indent, or by four backticks (` ```` `), i.e.
the following markup:

    ````
    Example of
        preformatted 
        text
    ````

will look like:

    Example of
        preformatted 
        text

This type of block visually correlates with `inline` code fragments. 

Style may be specified the following way:

    ````text
    This is a light code block example.
        It is also preformatted
        but has no background.
    ````

The result will be:

````text
This is a light code block example.
    It is also preformatted
    but has no background.
````

There are also shell code block (marked as `shell`):

````shell
$ echo "This block demonstrates operations in a shell"
This block demonstrates operations in a shell
````

and program language code block (marked as `code`):

````code
System.out.println("This block demonstrates " + 
    "a source code in a program language.");
````

!!! note
    Program language source code syntax highlighting is not implemented yet.

> Fenced blocks may be inserted inside other blocks like `blockquote`s:
> 
> ````shell
> $ echo Fenced blocks inside a blockquote
> Fenced blocks inside a blockquote
> ```` 
> 
> Also, for instance, lists inside `blockquote`s may contain fenced code blocks:
> 
> - Item 1:
>     ````
>     Fenced block, line 1
>     Fenced block, line 2
>     ````
> - Item 2


## Wrapping

Sometimes it's required to have long lines inside code blocks wrapped, but the above code
blocks don't wrap the lines automatically. Of cause we can break the lines manually but this 
may make the content inconvenient for copy-pasting. To address this cases, additional markers
`wrapped`, `wrapped-code` and `wrapped-shell` were defined. Here's an example:

````wrapped-code
This is a long line that doesn't contain line breaks inside itself and that we want to be automatically wrapped so that the fenced code block doesn't exceed the page width.
````

<!--index admonitions -->
# Admonitions

!!! info
    Admonitions are specially formatted blocks whose purpose is drawing attention to some pieces
    of information. To add such a block the following syntax is used:
 
    ````
    !!! qualifier "Optional title"
        block content
        with 4 space indent on each line
    ````
 
!!! note
    There are defined the following qualifiers:
    
    - `note`;
    - tips: `tip`, `hint`, `important`;
    - danger: `danger`, `error`;
    - warning: `warning`, `attention`, `caution`.
 
!!! important
    Other qualifiers may be used (like `info` qualifier above). CSS need to be edited to
    add special formatting for this admonitions, otherwise the default formatting is used.
 
!!! warning "Don't overuse!"
    This highlighting method should not be overused. When there are a lot of such blocks
    important information may be easily missed by the reader.
 
    BTW, in this block a custom title is used.
 
!!! hint ""
    To place an admonition without a header empty quotes may be set as the title:
 
    ````
    !!! hint ""
        This admonition will not have a title.
    ````
!!! danger
    Admonitions are not supported in GitHub and StackOverflow.
 
    !!! note
        When a default title is used its first character is capitalized.
