# About plugins

Plugins automate and simplify typical tasks and make the documentation more structural and easy
to use.

The main approach used by this program is no interference in the Markdown syntax. So the
documentation content must be readable in plain text even without processing by this program.
Plugins provide extra possibilities for the templates processing and visualization.

See [here](<!--page reference-->#argument_file_example) for an example of how plugins are defined in 
the *argument file*.

# "relative-paths" plugin

**Motivation**

The program generates static HTML pages that reference other pages and resources like CSS and
pictures. The generated HTML pages may be located in different places of the project structure, 
so the same resources must be referenced differently from different pages.

In the following example:

````shell
$ tree -L 2 --charset=ascii --dirsfirst
.
|-- doc
|   |-- about.html
|   `-- styles.css
|-- pict
|   `-- logo.png
`-- readme.html
````

the reference to `styles.css` is:

- `doc/styles.css` from the `readme.html` page;
- and `styles.css` from the `about.html` page.

This plugin automatically recalculates relative paths for certain pages depending on their location
and avoids manual definition of these paths for every page individually. It also allows 
substitution of such paths inside the documents.


**Definition**

Here's an example of the plugin definition:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "readme.txt", "output": "readme.html", "title": "Home" },
        { "input": "doc_src/about.txt", "output": "doc/about.html", "title": "About" }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "relative-paths": {
            "markers": ["path"],
            "paths": {
                "resource_path": "doc/",
                "pict": "doc/pict/"
            }
        }
    }
}
````

This is the new syntax. The previous syntax (that doesn't support substitution inside documents)
is also supported:

````
        "relative-paths": { "resource_path": "doc/" }
````

In this example, `resource_path` and `pict` are path *codes*, and the corresponding values are 
paths themselves.

The plugin considers the paths and the current page location being relative to the
same location, that is the program invocation current directory in this case. When it
calculates the path with the code `resource_path` then:

- for the page `readme.html`, it'll return `doc/`;
- for the page `doc/about.html` it'll return `""` (empty path, as they are located in the same
    directory).


**Usage**

Include the following _tag_ to the template:

````
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{resource_path}}styles.css"/>
````

That's it. When a document using this template is generated, this tag will be replaced with
the desired path.

For substitution inside a document insert the text like this:

````
![](<!--ignore path pict-->logo.png) 
````

After the page is generated this fragment will look like this:

For page `readme.html`  | For page `doc/about.html`
------------------------|--------------------------
`![](pict/logo.png)`    | `![](../pict/logo.png)`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "page-flows" plugin

**Motivation**

Sidebar provides quick access to different project pages. It's often very helpful to put a
sequence of pages that are intended to be read in order. Doing it manually is pretty
cumbersome and error-prone.

This plugin defines such pages sequences and and provides them for easy manipulation in templates.


**Definition**

!!! note
    You may want to also look at the new syntax described
    [here](<!--page plugins-->#page_flows_new_syntax).
    
In the `"plugins"` sections:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "page1.txt", "output": "page1.html", "title": "Page 1" },
        { "input": "page2.txt", "output": "doc/page2.html", "title": "Page 2" },
        { "input": "page3.txt", "output": "doc/page3.html", "title": "Page 3" }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "page-flows": {
            "sidebar": [
                { "link": "page1.html", "title": "Page 1" },
                { "link": "doc/page2.html", "title": "Page 2" },
                { "link": "doc/page3.html", "title": "Page 3" },
                { "link": "www.google.com", "title": "Page 3", "external": true }
            ]
        }
    }
}
````

In the above example the three pages are defined twice. To avoid such repetition the page flows 
may be defined directly in the `"documents"` section:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "page1.txt", "title": "Page 1", "page-flows": ["sidebar"] },
        { "input": "page2.txt", "title": "Page 2", "page-flows": ["sidebar"] },
        { "input": "page3.txt", "title": "Page 3", "page-flows": ["sidebar"] }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "page-flows": {}
    }
}
````

But the plugin itself must be activated to make it work. So even if all page flows are defined
in the `"documents"` section the plugin empty definition must be added to the `"plugins"`
section.

The `"page-flows"` document definition may be carried out to the `"default"` section (not
demonstrated here). Several page flows may be defined and a single page may be a part of several
page flows.

**Usage**

In a template, each page flow is accessible by its name (`sidebar` in the above example) and
provides the following structured data:

Field | Description
----- | -----
`{{_name_}}` | Iterable, returns [pages](#page_flow_page_structure)
`{{_name_.previous}}` | Previous [page](#page_flow_page_structure) if exists
`{{_name_.current}}` | Current [page](#page_flow_page_structure) if exists
`{{_name_.next}}` | Next [page](#page_flow_page_structure) if exists
`{{_name_.has_navigation}}` | Boolean, `true` if ether previous or next page exist
`{{_name_.not_empty}}` | Boolean, `true` if contains at least one page

<a name="page_flow_page_structure"></a>
The page has the following structure:

Field | Description
----- | -----
`{{link}}` | The link that references the page. Recalculated for the current page
`{{title}}` | The title of the page
`{{external}}` | Boolean, external pages can never be current
`{{first}}` | Boolean, `true` if this is the first page in the sequence
`{{last}}` | Boolean, `true` if this is the last page in the sequence

This data is calculated for every page that uses this template. So for the current page we can 
know the previous and the next pages and render the navigations. Here's a simple example:

````
{{#sidebar.previous}}<a href="{{link}}">[PREVIOUS]</a>{{/sidebar.previous}}
{{#sidebar.next}}<a href="{{link}}">[NEXT]</a>{{/sidebar.next}}
````

!!! tip "Explanation"
    `{{#sidebar.previous}}...{{/sidebar.previous}}` means that if `sidebar.previous` value 
    exists then the enclosed content is rendered. `sidebar.previous` value is a page and has
    attribute `link` that is used in the rendered block.

Also for the current page we have the whole page sequence of the page flow and can render this
list in the sidebar. As we know which page or pages are current, we can highlight this links.
Here's a simplified example of how the sidebar items may be rendered:

````
<ul>{{#sidebar}}
<li><a class="sidebarItem{{#current}} selected{{/current}}" href="{{link}}">{{title}}</a></li>
{{/sidebar}}</ul>
````

!!! tip "Explanation"
    `{{#sidebar}}...{{/sidebar}}` means that for each item in the `sidebar` value (that is 
    iterable) render the enclosed content. The items are pages and their attributes `link`,
    `title` and `current` are used in the rendered block.

This documentation demonstrates pretty typical usage of this plugin. Also see the template
`doc_src/templates/multipage.html` and the _argument file_ `md2html_args.json` for more
understanding of correspondence between the plugin's definition and usage.

<a name="page_flows_new_syntax"></a>
**New syntax**

In version 1.0.3 new syntax was introduced. The following example demonstrates the differences:

````
.  .  .
    "plugins": {
        "page-flows": {
            "sections": { "groups": ["sidebar"] },
            "header": [
                { "link": "readme.html", "title": "Home" },
                { "link": "doc/content/sections/installation.html", "title": "Installation" },
                { "link": "doc/content/sections/usage.html", "title": "Usage" }
            ],
            "useful_links": { "title": "Useful links", "groups": ["sidebar"], "items": [
                { "link": "https://mustache.github.io/", "title": "Mustache", "external": true },
                { "link": "https://json.org/", "title": "JSON", "external": true }
            ]}
        },
    }
.  .  .
````

The `useful_links` *page flow* is defined using the full syntax. The *page flow* has a title, a list
of groups and the content defined by the `items` attributes. The content definition is a list of
the pages just the same way as in the old syntax.

The `sections` *page flow* defines only the necessary attributes. The title is an empty string by
default. The content is empty initially and it may be defined in the `documents` section.

The `header` *page flow* uses the old syntax. Two syntaxes may be used in the same argument file
that makes the previously written documentation compatible with the new version of the program.

The purpose of this change is to remove specific elements from the
[templates](<!--page templates-->) and to avoid boilerplates. Now sidebar *page flows* may be
defined solely in the argument file and the template file in the documentation project
may be updated with the other one taken from the outside without subsequent customization.
Here's a sidebar definition that may be defined for the above argument file fragment:

````
{{#sidebar}}
{{#title}}<h3>{{.}}</h3>{{/title}}
{{#.}}<a class="sidebar_item{{#current}} selected{{/current}}" href="{{link}}">{{title}}</a>
{{/.}}
{{/sidebar}}
````

The `sidebar` variable contains a list of *page flows* for which it's defined (here there are 
two such *page flows*). As each *page flow* now has a title then this title may be conditionally
rendered using the Mustache syntax. Elements `{{#.}}` and `{{/.}}` represent a current 
*page flow* that here is represented as a number of links. Current links are highlighted 
with a CSS class `selected`.

<a name="page_variables_plugin"></a>
# "page-variables" plugin

**Motivation**

This plugin extracts variables from documents source text and provides these variables to be
used in the template.

**Definition**

````
    "plugins": {
        "page-variables": {"variables": {"only-at-page-start": true} }
    }
````

<!--index page metadata -->
This means that variables will be extracted from the _page metadata_ blocks with marker
`variables` and only from those blocks that are the first non-blank text on the page.
This is the definition of the default marker so it may be simplified to `"page-variables": {}`,
and this is the recommended form.

**Usage**

For the above plugin definition the metadata blocks may look like:

````
<!--variables {"title": "My page", "noPageTitle": true}-->
````

The marker is `variables` and it is case insensitive. The variables are `title` and `noPageTitle`
and the tags `{{title}}` and `{{noPageTitle}}` will be replaced with the defined values when
this page is processed.

The _page metadata_ blocks will be removed from the source text if they are recognized and
processed by the defined markers.

The metadata content must be a valid [JSON](https://json.org/).

!!! Note
    Opening `<!--` and closing markers `-->` must not be used inside the metadata
    section. Also consecutive hyphens `--` inside HTML comments may probably be a problem in some
    browsers. In JSON strings, Unicode entities may be used to resolve these issues, i.e. string
    `"<!\u002D-text-\u002D>"` will be interpreted as `"<!--text-->"`. Still, depending on the 
    page content and the context, opening and closing markers, even when escaped in JSON, may 
    cause unexpected result. Check it first if you really need to use these symbols.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "variables" plugin

**Motivation**

This plugin defines variables that are not bound to certain pages. Actually such values may be
included directly into the template with no need of using this plugin. But when the same template
is used by several projects it may be convenient to define some template variable parts that
different projects may substitute using their _argument files_.

**Definition**

````
"variables": {"logo": "<img src=\"logo.png\" />" }
````

**Usage**

Tag (or tags) `{{{logo}}}` in the template will be substituted in the template. (Note that in
this case three pairs of curly braces are used to avoid HTML-escaping on substitution.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--index index-->
# "index" plugin

**Motivation**

Some terms, abbreviations and other kind of keywords may be defined, described and mentioned
in different pages within the documentation. Searching such keywords may be hard,
especially if the documentation is large. This plugin allows marking such points on the pages
as _index entries_ and then collects these entries and put them together on a separate 
_index page_. See the [index page](../index_page.html) of this documentation as an example.

**Definition**

````
"plugins": {
    "index": {"index": {"output": "index_page.html", "title": "Index", "index-cache": "index_cache.json", 
                        "index-cache-relative": true, "letters": true, "letters-block": true }
            }
}
````

This example defines one index with marker `index`. It's possible to define several indexes with
different markers.

All possible properties are listed in the table below. They are mostly the same as those 
of the [`documents` section](<!--page reference-->#documents_section) so see that section for the
absent descriptions.

Name | Type | Required | Default | Description
---- | ---- | :----: | ---- | ----
output-root | string | No |  | |
output | string | Yes |  | Index page that must be created: absolute or relative to the `output-root` property value
title | string | No |  | |
template | string | No |  | |
link-css | array of string | No |  | |
include-css | array of string | No |  | |
no-css | boolean | No |  | |
add-link-css | array of string | No |  | |
add-include-css | array of string | No |  | |
page-flows | array of string | No |  | |
add-page-flows | array of string | No |  | |
verbose | boolean | No |  | |
report | boolean | No |  | |
index-cache | string | Yes |  | Index cache file (see the note below)
index-cache-relative | boolean | No | false | `true` means that the index cache file location is defined relative to the index page location
letters | boolean | No | false | `true` means that the index page content will be divided by the terms first letters
letters-block | boolean | No | false | `true` means that all terms first letters will be listed at the top of the index page
        
!!! note "Index cache file"
    _Index page_ is generated using the entries from all the documents but
    the program may regenerate the documentation project partially, i.e. it may regenerate
    only those documents that were changed or added since the previous program run.
    In order to always generate a complete index page the program uses an _index cache file_
    that keeps the collected index entries between the runs.
    
    In some cases a forceful full regeneration (with `-f` flag or `"force": true` option, 
    see [here](<!--page usage-->) for more details) is required, for example, if the "index" plugin is
    activated on an existing project or if the index cache file is deleted. 
    
    Index cache file is a generated artifact so in case of any problem it may be manually deleted
    and the further forceful full documents regeneration may resolve the problem.


**Usage**

Index entries may be added in two different ways:
<a name="escaped_code_text_example"></a>

- using a single-term entry like `<!--ignore index Term 2 -->`;
- using a multiple-term entry like `<!--ignore INDEX ["term 1", "term 3"]-->`.

The `index` marker is case-insensitive. If the above two entries are added then the index page
will be generated with terms "term 1", "Term 2" and "term 3" in the sorted order.

In the index page, the term list will be included into a `<div class="index-content">` element.
The term first letter delimiters will look like this:

````
<p class="index-letter" id="index_letter_A">A</p>
````

The terms themselves will look like this:

````
<p class="index-entry"><a href="usage.html#index_entry_1" title="Usage">argument file</a></p>
````

The first letter link block will look like this:

````
<p class="index_letters">
    <a href="#index_letter_A">A</a>
    <a href="#index_letter_C">C</a>
    .  .  .
</p>
````

The above information allows define desirable styling with CSS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "page-links" plugin

**Motivation**

HTML pages inside documentation usually reference each other using links. A link specifies its 
target relative to the page where it's placed. When the target page is moved or renamed the link
need to be modified accordingly, otherwise it won't work. And what's worse, all pages that
reference the relocated page need to be found and modified. This plugin automatically calculates 
link target pages location thus eliminating the need of specifying them manually.

**Definition**

To make this plugin work the target document must have a `code`. Here is an example of an argument
file that uses this plugin:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "page1.txt", "code": "p1" },
        { "input": "subdir/page2.txt", "code-from-variable": "code" }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "page-variables": {},
        "page-links": { "markers": ["page"] }
    }
}
````

The first page has a code `p1` specified in the document definition. The second page has a code
(let's say `p2`) specified in the page _metadata_ (see the 
["page-variables" plugin](#page_variables_plugin)), variable `code`. If page _metadata_ is used
then "page-variables" plugin must be activated.

_Marker_ `page` is defined in the "page-links" plugin. There may be several markers.


**Usage**

On the page `page1.txt` the following link to the page `subdir/page2.txt` may be added: 
`[](<!--page p2-->#some_anchor)` and the plugin will convert it to 
`[](subdir/page2.html#some_anchor)`. Consequently link `[](<!--page p1-->)` on the second page will
become `[](../page1.html)`.

!!! attention
    1. If a page is moved or renamed, some other pages may need to be regenerated to reflected this
        change. But those pages may be up-to-date, so a forceful full regeneration may be required
        (with `-f` flag or `"force": true` option, see [here](<!--page usage-->) for more details).
    2. Changing a page's `code` will invalidate all links that reference this page by its `code`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "ignore" plugin

**Motivation**

Different plugins fulfill page metadata substitution. But sometimes it's required to show a
metadata block without substitutions. To achieve that, there are methods that use direct HTML
inclusions and masking, but they are quite tedious and cumbersome. This plugin gives an easy
way of doing that.

**Definition**

Here is an example of an *argument file* that uses this plugin:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "page1.txt" }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "ignore": { "markers": ["ignore"] }
    }
}
````

The example shows the default *marker* usage, so the other, and recommended, way is the following 
definition: `"ignore": { }`. There may be several markers if required.

**Usage**

Let's consider two different code blocks:

````
![](<!--path pict-->logo.png)
````

and 

````
![](<!--ignore path pict-->logo.png)
````

In the first block the source text is `![](<!--ignore path pict-->logo.png)` and substitution
is fulfilled, while in the second block the source text is 
`![](<!--ignore ignore path pict-->logo.png)` so substitution is omitted.
