# About plugins

Plugins automate and simplify typical tasks and make the documentation more structural and easy
to use.

The main approach used by this program is no interference in the Markdown syntax. So the
documentation content must be readable in plain text even without processing by this program.
Plugins provide extra possibilities for the templates processing and visualization.

See [here](usage.html#argument_file_example) for an example of how plugins are defined in 
the *argument file*.

# "relative-paths" plugin

## Motivation

The program generates static HTML pages that reference other pages and resources like CSS and
pictures. The generated HTML pages may be located in different places of the project structure, 
so the same resources must be referenced differently from different pages.

In the following example:

````shell
$ tree -L 2 --charset=ascii --dirsfirst
.
|-- doc
|   |-- about.html
|   `-- styles.css
`-- readme.html
````

the reference to `styles.css` is:

- `doc/styles.css` from the `readme.html` page;
- and `styles.css` from the `about.html` page.

This plugin automatically recalculates relative paths for certain pages depending on their location
and avoids manual definition of these paths for every page individually.


## Definition

Here's an example of the plugin definition:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "readme.txt", "output": "readme.html", "title": "Home" },
        { "input": "doc_src/about.txt", "output": "doc/about.html", "title": "About" }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "relative-paths": { "resource_path": "doc/" }
    }
}
````

The plugin considers the `"resource_path"` and the current page location being relative to the
same location, that is the program invocation current directory in this case. When it
calculates the path then:

- for the page `readme.html`, it'll return `doc/`;
- for the page `doc/about.html` it'll return `""` (empty path, as they are located in the same
    directory).


## Usage

Include the following _tag_ to the template:

````
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{resource_path}}styles.css"/>
````

That's it. When a document using this template is generated, this tag will be replaced with
the corresponding path.

# "page-flows" plugin

## Motivation

Sidebar provides quick access to different project pages. It's often very helpful to put a
sequence of pages that are intended to be read in order. Doing it manually is pretty
cumbersome and error-prone.

This plugin defines such pages sequences and and provides them for easy manipulation in templates.

## Definition

In the `"plugins"` sections:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "page1.txt", "output": "page1.html", "title": "Page 1" },
        { "input": "page2.txt", "output": "doc/page2.html", "title": "Page 2" },
        { "input": "page3.txt", "output": "doc/page3.html", "title": "Page 3" }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "page-flows": {
            "sidebar": [
                { "link": "page1.html", "title": "Page 1" },
                { "link": "doc/page2.html", "title": "Page 2" },
                { "link": "doc/page3.html", "title": "Page 3" },
                { "link": "www.google.com", "title": "Page 3", "external": true }
            ]
        }
    }
}
````

In the above example the three pages are defined twice. To avoid such repetition the page flows 
may be defined directly in the `"documents"` section:

````
{
    "documents": [
        { "input": "page1.txt", "title": "Page 1", "page-flows": ["sidebar"] },
        { "input": "page2.txt", "title": "Page 2", "page-flows": ["sidebar"] },
        { "input": "page3.txt", "title": "Page 3", "page-flows": ["sidebar"] }
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "page-flows": {}
    }
}
````

But the plugin itself must be activated to make it work. So even if all page flows are defined
in the `"documents"` section the plugin empty definition must be added to the `"plugins"`
section.

The `"page-flows"` document definition may be carried out to the `"default"` section (not
demonstrated here). Several page flows may be defined and a single page may be a part of several
page flows.

## Usage

In a template, each page flow is accessible by its name (`sidebar` in the above example) and
provides the following structured data:

Field | Description
----- | -----
`{{_name_}}` | Iterable, returns [pages](#page_flow_page_structure)
`{{_name_.previous}}` | Previous [page](#page_flow_page_structure) if exists
`{{_name_.current}}` | Current [page](#page_flow_page_structure) if exists
`{{_name_.next}}` | Next [page](#page_flow_page_structure) if exists
`{{_name_.has_navigation}}` | Boolean, `true` if ether previous or next page exist
`{{_name_.not_empty}}` | Boolean, `true` if contains at least one page

<a name="page_flow_page_structure"></a>
The page has the following structure:

Field | Description
----- | -----
`{{link}}` | The link that references the page. Recalculated for the current page
`{{title}}` | The title of the page
`{{external}}` | Boolean, external pages can never be current
`{{first}}` | Boolean, `true` if this is the first page in the sequence
`{{last}}` | Boolean, `true` if this is the last page in the sequence

This data is calculated for every page that uses this template. So for the current page we can 
know the previous and the next pages and render the navigations. Here's a simple example:

````
{{#sidebar.previous}}<a href="{{link}}">[PREVIOUS]</a>{{/sidebar.previous}}
{{#sidebar.next}}<a href="{{link}}">[NEXT]</a>{{/sidebar.next}}
````

!!! tip "Explanation"
    `{{#sidebar.previous}}...{{/sidebar.previous}}` means that if `sidebar.previous` value 
    exists then the enclosed content is rendered. `sidebar.previous` value is a page and has
    attribute `link` that is used in the rendered block.

Also for the current page we have the whole page sequence of the page flow and can render this
list in the sidebar. As we know which page or pages are current, we can highlight this links.
Here's a simplified example of how the sidebar items may be rendered:

````
<ul>{{#sidebar}}
<li><a class="sidebarItem{{#current}} selected{{/current}}" href="{{link}}">{{title}}</a></li>
{{/sidebar}}</ul>
````

!!! tip "Explanation"
    `{{#sidebar}}...{{/sidebar}}` means that for each item in the `sidebar` value (that is 
    iterable) render the enclosed content. The items are pages and their attributes `link`,
    `title` and `current` are used in the rendered block.

This documentation demonstrates pretty typical usage of this plugin. Also see the template
`doc_src/templates/custom.html` and the _argument file_ `md2html_args.json` for more
understanding of correspondence between the plugin's definition and usage.

# "page-variables" plugin

## Motivation

This plugin extracts variables from documents source text and provides these variables to be
used in the template.

## Definition

````
    "plugins": {
        "page-variables": {"variables": {"only-at-page-start": true} }
    }
````

<!--index page metadata -->
This means that variables will be extracted from the _page metadata_ blocks with marker
`variables` and only from those blocks that are the first non-blank text on the page.
This is the definition of the default marker so it may be simplified to `"page-variables": {}`,
and this is the recommended form.

## Usage

For the above plugin definition the metadata blocks may look like:

````
<!--variables {"title": "My page", "noPageTitle": true}-->
````

The marker is `variables` and it is case insensitive. The variables are `title` and `noPageTitle`
and the tags `{{title}}` and `{{noPageTitle}}` will be replaced with the defined values when
this page is processed.

The _page metadata_ blocks will be removed from the source text if they are recognized and
processed by the defined markers.

The metadata content must be a valid [JSON](https://json.org/).

!!! Note
    Opening `<!--` and closing markers `-->` must not be used inside the metadata
    section. Also consecutive hyphens `--` inside HTML comments may probably be a problem in some
    browsers. In JSON strings, Unicode entities may be used to resolve these issues, i.e. string
    `"<!\u002D-text-\u002D>"` will be interpreted as `"<!--text-->"`. Still, depending on the 
    page content and the context, opening and closing markers, even when escaped in JSON, may 
    cause unexpected result. Check it first if you really need to use these symbols.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "variables" plugin

## Motivation

This plugin defines variables that are not bound to certain pages. Actually such values may be
included directly into the template with no need of using this plugin. But when the same template
is used by several projects it may be convenient to define some template variable parts that
different projects may substitute using their _argument files_.

## Definition

````
"variables": {"logo": "<img src=\"logo.png\" />" }
````

## Usage

Tag (or tags) `{{{logo}}}` in the template will be substituted in the template. (Note that in
this case three pairs of curly braces are used to avoid HTML-escaping on substitution.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--index index-->
# "index" plugin

## Motivation

Some terms, abbreviations and other kind of keywords may be defined, described and mentioned
in different pages within the documentation. Searching such keywords may be hard,
especially if the documentation is large. This plugin allows marking such points on the pages
as _index entries_ and then collects these entries and put them together on a separate 
_index page_. See the [index page](index_page.html) of this documentation as an example.

## Definition

````
"plugins": {
    "index": {"index": {"output": "index_page.html", "title": "Index", "index-cache": "index_cache.json", 
                        "index-cache-relative": true, "letters": true, "letters-block": true }
            }
}
````

This example defines one index with marker `index`. It's possible to define several indexes with
different markers.

All possible properties are listed in the table below. They are mostly the same as those 
of the [`documents` section](usage.html#documents_section) so see that section for the
absent descriptions.

Name | Type | Required | Default | Description
---- | ---- | :----: | ---- | ----
output-root | string | No |  | |
output | string | Yes |  | Index page that must be created: absolute or relative to the `output-root` property value
title | string | No |  | |
template | string | No |  | |
link-css | array of string | No |  | |
include-css | array of string | No |  | |
no-css | boolean | No |  | |
add-link-css | array of string | No |  | |
add-include-css | array of string | No |  | |
page-flows | array of string | No |  | |
add-page-flows | array of string | No |  | |
verbose | boolean | No |  | |
report | boolean | No |  | |
index-cache | string | Yes |  | Index cache file (see the note below)
index-cache-relative | boolean | No | false | `true` means that the index cache file location is defined relative to the index page location
letters | boolean | No | false | `true` means that the index page content will be divided by the terms first letters
letters-block | boolean | No | false | `true` means that all terms first letters will be listed at the top of the index page
        
!!! note "Index cache file"
    _Index page_ is generated using the entries from all the documents but
    the program may regenerate the documentation project partially, i.e. it may regenerate
    only those documents that were changed or added since the previous program run.
    In order to always generate a complete index page the program uses an _index cache file_
    that keeps the collected index entries between the runs.
    
    In some cases a forceful full regeneration (with `-f` flag or `"force": true` option, 
    see [here](usage.html) for more details) is required, for example, if the "index" plugin is
    activated on an existing project or if the index cache file is deleted. 
    
    Index cache file is a generated artifact so in case of any problem it may be manually deleted
    and the further forceful full documents regeneration may resolve the problem.


## Usage

Index entries may be added in two different ways:
<a name="escaped_code_text_example"></a>

- using a single-term entry like <span class="code">&lt;!--index Term 2 --></span>;
- using a multiple-term entry like <span class="code">&lt;!--INDEX ["term 1", "term 3"]--></span>.

The `index` marker is case-insensitive. If the above two entries are added then the index page
will be generated with terms "term 1", "Term 2" and "term 3" in the sorted order.

In the index page, the term list will be included into a `<div class="index-content">` element.
The term first letter delimiters will look like this:

````
<p class="index-letter" id="index_letter_A">A</p>
````

The terms themselves will look like this:

````
<p class="index-entry"><a href="usage.html#index_entry_1" title="Usage">argument file</a></p>
````

The first letter link block will look like this:

````
<p class="index_letters">
    <a href="#index_letter_A">A</a>
    <a href="#index_letter_C">C</a>
    .  .  .
</p>
````

The above information allows define desirable styling with CSS.
