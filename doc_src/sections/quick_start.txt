<!--index quick start-->
This documentation gives the program's [usage](<!--page usage-->) detailed description 
as well as the [page content](<!--page page_content-->) writing methods and tricks. But this 
information is probably not necessary for just trying the program out. The program provides 
a quick-start script that creates a simple new project with a 
[typical structure](<!--page usage-->#typical_project_structure) 
and with some sample content.

!!! note
    As for now the quick start script is implemented for Windows only.

Before using this script the program must be installed, see the 
[Installation section](<!--page installation-->).

As the program is installed, create an empty directory where the documentation must be set up,
then switch to there in the command line terminal and execute:

````shell
>cd C:\your\path\your_project

>%MD2HTML_HOME%\bin\new_project\new_project.bat
````

All necessary project files will be created in the directory `your_project`. Just generate 
the documentation by double-clicking the command file `generate_doc_py.bat` or 
`generate_doc_java.bat`. Open the generated file `readme.html` in the project's root 
directory to see the content.
