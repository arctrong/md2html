# What is template?

In this program [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) template engine is used for HTML
templates processing. A simple template file may look like this:

````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>{{title}}</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
{{{styles}}}
</head>
<body>
{{{content}}}
<hr />
<p style="font-size: smaller;">Generated by {{exec_name}} {{exec_version}}
{{generation_date}} {{generation_time}}</p>
</body>
</html>
````

It consists of static HTML code and Mustache _tags_ that define substitutions and other kind
of template processing actions. In this simple example only substitutions are defined. The
tags with **three** pairs of curly braces will be substituted with the provided values without
change. The tags with **two** pairs of curly braces will be substituted with the HTML-escaped
provided values.

The program provides values for the following _keys_ by default:

Tag key | Description
----- | -----
`{{title}}` | The page title
`{{{styles}}}` | Included and/or linked CSS
`{{{content}}}` | The result of the Markdown document processing
`{{exec_name}}` | The self name provided by the program
`{{exec_version}}` | The program version (meaning the numbers, not Python or Java)
`{{generation_date}}` | The generation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
`{{generation_time}}` | The generation time (hh:mm:ss)
`{{source_file}}` | The source text file resolved relatively to the current HTML page

The other tags may be provided by _plugins_ that are described in the
[separate section](<!--page plugins-->).

!!! important
    The number of curly braces pairs (two or three) is meaningful. Use them for the certain tags
    as it's presented in the table above.

# Provided templates

This documentation is created using an extended template that contains some project specific 
elements and is intended to be used with _plugins_. Anyway this template may be suitable for 
other writing works with minimal or no modifications. It's recommended to copy this
template to other projects in order to make it independent of the further modifications
of this program (as this documentation is the part of the program). The template itself, the
corresponding CSS files and some images must be copied. This template location is 
`doc_src/templates/multipage.html`.

There's also a simpler template, `doc_src/templates/default.html`, that is used as the default
in some cases. This template may also be used in other projects, probably in simpler and smaller
ones.

<!--index CSS-->
# CSS

There are two main CSS files used in this documentation: 

- `doc/layout/styles.css`, mainly defines appearance of the page content;
- `doc/layout/layout.css`, defines appearance and geometry (like the header and the sidebar) 
    of the `multipage.html` template and redefines some rules for the page content;
- `doc/theme.css`, is intended for customization in the other projects. This way the above 
    CSS files will stay unchanged and may be safely replaced with newer versions when they appear
    in this project.
