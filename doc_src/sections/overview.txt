# Common schema

The program accepts the following artifacts as the input:

- source Markdown texts;
- one or several HTML templates;
- one argument file;
- HTML page resources.

The program processes these artifacts and generates a set of static HTML pages that may 
represent a logically related documentation with a sidebar menu, navigation, index and 
other features.

The following subsections describe the above artifacts in more details.

<p style="clear: both;"></p>


## Source Markdown texts

These texts comprise the main documentation content written by the author. They are written in 
the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) markup language. The 
[Page content section](<!--page page_content-->) describes the methods, tricks and elements that
may be used in process of the content writing.


## HTML templates

An HTML artifact that is generated out of a markdown text is not a complete HTML page. It's
just a fragment that must be put inside the `<body>...</body>` HTML element. A _template_ may
be considered as an HTML page that doesn't have the main content but just specifies the place
(placeholder) where this content must be inserted. 

See [here](<!--page templates-->) for more details about templates and other placeholders that 
may be used in templates.


## Argument file

The _argument file_ defines the set of input source files and different parameters for the 
following HTML documents generation. See [here](<!--page usage-->#using_argument_file) 
for more details.


## HTML page resources

Different resources, like CSS and images are not processed by the program. The program may just
adjust the location of these resources while putting link on them to the certain pages. 
These are usually [plugins](<!--page plugins-->) that perform these adjustments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Restrictions

The program doesn't restrict HTML code inside the Markdown texts. Particularly, these texts 
may contain JavaScript that will be translated unchanged into the generated HTML page. This
must not be a problem for personal use but may be a security issue when converting and
publishing source texts from untrusted third-parties. Click the image below to see how it may
look like.

!!! tip
    In case of worry first have a look at the source text by clicking at the "Source text"
    link ("&lt;/&gt;") at the page top.
