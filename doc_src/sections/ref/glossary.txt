<!--index ["study notes"]-->
**Study notes**. This term refers to a concise summary or outline of material, often used for study
purposes. Depending on the context and the specific nature of the notes, we might also consider
the terms such as "lecture notes", "summary", or "synopsis". However if the notes encompass a
broader range of study materials then "study notes" is likely the most versatile and accurate
term. [<!--ref chat_gpt-->]

<!--index ["sidesteps"]-->
**Sidesteps** --- a terms that conveys the idea of exploring tangential topics related to the main
subject matter of some study notes. The following alternative terms might be found:
"peripheral investigations", "tangential explorations", "adjacent topics", "side topics",
"ancillary explorations"; but they all have more narrow, specific meanings, so "sidesteps"
is probably the broadest term that denotes this matter. [<!--ref chat_gpt-->]
