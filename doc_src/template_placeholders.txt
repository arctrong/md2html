# Template placeholders usage demo

This page is generated using a special template that demonstrates template placeholders usage.

The predefined `${styles}` placeholder is not used in this template, so no CSS were added 
during the page processing. The styles are defined directly in the template.

Several custom template placeholders were defined in this page metadata correctly and incorrectly:

Placeholder key	| Placeholder definition
---|---
`${placeholder1}` | undefined and must be represented as is
`${Placeholder1}` | defined, placeholder keys are case sensitive
`${placeholder2}` | defined but its value is not a string

Incorrectly defined placeholders are represented as is, the page processing doesn't stop.

Also note that using double dollar character (`$${Placeholder1}`) in a template escapes the 
dollar character from being interpreted as the a placeholder marker.
