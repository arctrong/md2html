**M<sub>2</sub>H** creates structured well formatted HTML documentation with minimal effort and
may be used for different types of writing works.

See the [complete documentation](https://arctrong.github.io/md2html/readme.html), that is created
using this tool, as an example of a possible achievable result.

# Features

**M<sub>2</sub>H** automates conversion of Markdown texts into HTML pages and provides templates
and styles that are ether ready to use or may be easily adapted and extended for certain tasks.

Apart of that it provides means for processing whole sets of documents, organizing the output
and producing a self-contained static HTML documentation that needs only a browser to be viewed.

In the end, this tool has a set of useful plugins that automate and simplify typical tasks and
make the documentation look more professionally.

# Implementation

**M<sub>2</sub>H** is a command line utility that has two versions: in Python and in Java. They
work mostly the same way, have the same command line syntax, process the same input, are shipped
together as source code and share some common artifacts like templates and styles, command
scripts, and this documentation. Despite this, the versions are independent and can be
used separately.

# On Linux

The Java and the Python executables are platform-independent so they will theoretically work in
all environments where the corresponding virtual machine is installed. The tests were done only
on Windows and Ubuntu Linux. The command scripts are provided in Windows CMD and Bash shell
formats.
